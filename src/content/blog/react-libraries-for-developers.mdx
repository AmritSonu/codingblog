React is a very popular tool to make websites and apps. In 2025, there are many libraries that can help developers build great projects easily. I’m learning React too, and I tried using some of these libraries to see how they work.

## 1. React Query

If your app gets data from a server, managing that data can be hard. React Query makes this job simple. It takes care of caching and updating data automatically.

**Why it’s good:**  
When I made a project to show user profiles, I didn’t have to write much code for loading or errors. React Query did all the hard work for me.

**Where to use it:**  
It’s great for apps like dashboards or online shopping websites.

## 2. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a cool way to style your app without writing a lot of CSS. You can just use small classes in your JSX to design your website.

**Why I like it:**  
I used Tailwind for my portfolio website, and it was so easy to make it look professional and responsive.

**Where to use it:**  
Use it in projects where you want the design to look good quickly.

## 3. Redux Toolkit

Managing app data can feel difficult, but Redux Toolkit makes it simple and clean. It reduces unnecessary code and helps you manage your app’s state better.

**Why I found it helpful:**  
I used it for a group project where we managed user login data. It made the app’s code neat and easy to understand.

**Where to use it:**  
For apps with many components that share data.

---

## 4. React Hook Form

Forms are needed in almost every app, but they can be hard to manage. React Hook Form makes creating and handling forms much easier.

**Why it’s useful:**  
I used it for a registration form in a school project. It made validation and submitting forms very smooth.

**Where to use it:**  
For apps with forms, like login pages or checkout pages.

## 5. Chakra UI

Chakra UI gives you pre-designed buttons, modals, and other components. It saves a lot of time and makes your app look professional.

**Why I like it:**  
I used it for a college project. It saved me time because I didn’t have to design anything from scratch.

**Where you can use it:**  
When you want a good-looking app quickly and don’t want to spend much time on design.

## 6. Recharts

Recharts is used for making graphs and charts. It’s easy and great for showing data visually.

**Why I like it:**  
I made a sales chart with it, and it looked professional, even though I’m not good at design!

**Where you can use it:**  
In apps that show data, like dashboards or reports.

## 7. Zustand

Zustand is a small and simple tool for managing app data. If Redux feels too complicated, try Zustand.

**Why I like it:**  
I used it for a weather app, and it was very easy to set up and use.

**Where you can use it:**  
We can build small apps.

## 8. React Testing Library

This library is used to check if everything is okay in our app and if the app is working well.

**Why I like it:**  
I used it to test a form in my app, and it helped me find and fix bugs easily.

**Where you can use it:**  
When you want to check if your app is working properly before launching it.

## 9. React DND

React DND lets you add drag-and-drop features to your app. It makes your app more fun and interactive for users.

**Why I like it:**  
I used it in a to-do app, where users could drag tasks around. It made the app look cool and modern.

**Where you can use it:**  
It’s good for apps like kanban boards (like Trello) or apps with file upload features.

## Conclusion

These are some of the React libraries I tried, and I really liked them. For example, React Query makes data handling simple, and Tailwind CSS makes designs look good quickly. I also liked Redux Toolkit for managing data and React Hook Form for handling forms easily.

When I used these libraries, I felt more confident because they saved me time and made my projects look better. Even though I’m still learning React, they helped me a lot. If you are new to React, you should try these libraries in your projects to make your learning journey easier and more fun!
