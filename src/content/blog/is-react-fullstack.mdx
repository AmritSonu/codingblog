If you are new to web development, you might think: “Is React full stack?”
The answer is no, React is not full stack. Don’t worry, I’ll explain it in a super simple way!

## What is React?

React is a **frontend library**. This means it helps you create the part of a website or app that people see and use.

For example, when you visit a shopping website, the things you see, like the “Add to Cart” button, product pictures, and text, are all part of the **frontend**.
React helps developers make these things quickly and easily.

- **Backend**: Where all the data is stored and managed.
- **Server**: Where the website or app is running.
- **Database**: Where the information, like product details or user data, is saved.

So, React is just one part of building a full website or app

## Why Developers Like React for Full Stack

- **Reusable Components:** When I started using React, I realized I could make small parts of my app and use them again wherever needed. It saved me so much time and made my work a lot easier and faster.

- **Great Community:** React has a big community, so if you ever get stuck, you can easily find help.

- **Easy to Learn:** If you’re a beginner, React is a good choice because it’s simple and there are so many tutorials online.
- **Fast and Responsive:** React apps are very fast because of something called virtual DOM. It helps update the app quickly without reloading everything.

## What Beginners Say About React in Full Stack

- “When I started learning React, I didn’t know anything about the backend. But when I combined it with Node.js and MongoDB, I built my first full-stack app. It was so exciting!”
- “React made working on the frontend so much easier for me. Later, I learned Express and MongoDB, and that’s how I made my projects full stack."
- “At first, I was confused if React alone is enough for full-stack. But after making my MERN project, I saw how React fits perfectly with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB."

## final tip

When I combined React with backend tools like Node.js and MongoDB, I was able to build some really cool full-stack projects.

If you’re new, I’d say start with React for the frontend. Once you’re comfortable, slowly learn backend stuff like Node.js and databases like MongoDB. Trust me, with practice, you’ll be able to create full-stack apps for your portfolio.

So now, if someone asks me, “Is React full stack?” I confidently say, “No, but it’s a big part of full-stack development!”
