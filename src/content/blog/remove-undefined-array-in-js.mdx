title: 'How to Remove Undefined from an Array in JavaScript?'
---

Hello! Are you learning JavaScript? Don’t worry! I’m here to explain things in simple, easy words. Today, we’ll learn how to remove `undefined` from an array in JavaScript step by step. 😊

---

## What is Undefined?

In JavaScript, `undefined` means that something exists but doesn’t have a value yet. Let me give you an example:

```javascript
let myVar
console.log(myVar) // Output: undefined
```

Here, `myVar` is created but has no value. So, it’s `undefined`.

Now imagine you have an array, and it has `undefined` values like this:

```javascript
let myArray = [1, undefined, 3, undefined, 5]
console.log(myArray) // Output: [1, undefined, 3, undefined, 5]
```

We don’t like these `undefined` values in our array because they don’t help us. Let’s learn how to clean them.

---

## Why Remove Undefined Values?

Here are some reasons:

1. **Clean Data**: A clean array looks better and is easier to use.
2. **No Errors**: `Undefined` values can sometimes cause problems in calculations or when displaying data.
3. **Professional Work**: When your code is clean, it looks more professional.

## How to Remove Undefined from an Array

There are many ways to remove `undefined` values. I will show you 3 simple methods. Choose the one you like the most!

### 1. Using the `.filter()` Method

The `.filter()` method is very easy to use. It checks every value in the array and keeps only the values you want.

**Example:**

```javascript
let myArray = [1, undefined, 3, undefined, 5]

let cleanArray = myArray.filter((item) => item !== undefined)

console.log(cleanArray) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

**How It Works:**

- `.filter()` looks at each item in the array.
- It keeps only the items that are not `undefined`.
- The result is a new array without `undefined` values.

---

### 2. Using a `for` Loop

If you are a beginner, you might feel comfortable with a loop. Here is how you can use a `for` loop:

**Example:**

```javascript
let myArray = [1, undefined, 3, undefined, 5]

let cleanArray = []

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	if (myArray[i] !== undefined) {
		cleanArray.push(myArray[i])
	}
}

console.log(cleanArray) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

**How It Works:**

1. The loop goes through each item in `myArray`.
2. It checks if the item is not `undefined`.
3. If the item is valid, it adds it to `cleanArray`.

---

### 3. Using `.reduce()`

If you like to experiment, try the `.reduce()` method. It collects valid values into one array.

**Example:**

```javascript
let myArray = [1, undefined, 3, undefined, 5]

let cleanArray = myArray.reduce((acc, item) => {
	if (item !== undefined) {
		acc.push(item)
	}
	return acc
}, [])

console.log(cleanArray) // Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

**How It Works:**

1. `.reduce()` starts with an empty array (`[]`).
2. It adds only the valid items (not `undefined`) to the array.

---

### Real-Life Example

Imagine you have a list of scores from a school test. Some scores are missing (`undefined`). You want to calculate the average score.

**Example:**

```javascript
let scores = [85, undefined, 90, undefined, 88]

let validScores = scores.filter((score) => score !== undefined)

console.log(validScores) // Output: [85, 90, 88]
```

**Now, you can use `validScores` to find the average or show them to others.**

---

### Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with `.filter()`:**  
   It is the easiest method to remove `undefined` values.

2. **Practice Loops:**  
   Learning loops will help you build logic for coding.

3. **Fix the Problem at the Source:**  
   If you see too many `undefined` values, check why they are there. Sometimes, the problem is with the data source, not the code.

---

### Bonus: Remove `null` and `NaN` Too

Sometimes, an array may have other bad values like `null` or `NaN`. Here’s how to clean them all:

**Example:**

```javascript
let myArray = [1, undefined, null, NaN, 3]

let cleanArray = myArray.filter((item) => item != null && !isNaN(item))

console.log(cleanArray) // Output: [1, 3]
```

### Explanation:

- `item != null` removes both `null` and `undefined`.
- `!isNaN(item)` removes `NaN`.

---

### Conclusion:

Removing `undefined` values from an array is very simple. Use `.filter()`, a `for` loop, or `.reduce()` to make your array clean.

**Keep practicing, and you’ll get better every day.**

**Remember:**  
JavaScript is not hard—it just takes time and effort to learn. 😊
