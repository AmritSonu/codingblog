title: 'How to Conditionally Add an Object to an Array in JavaScript'
---

Hi! If you are learning JavaScript do not worry. I will explain this topic in very simple words. We are going to learn how to add an object to an array only if a condition is true. Don’t be scared; it’s very easy! 😊

## What Does "Conditionally Add" Mean?

"Conditionally add" means adding something to an array only when a rule is true. For example:

- Add a student to a list if their age is more than 18.
- Add an item to your shopping cart if it is available in stock.

This way, we don’t add everything—we add only the things we need.

---

## Example 1: Adding an Object to an Array

Let’s start with a very easy example:

```javascript
let students = [] // This is an empty array for students

let newStudent = { name: 'Ali', age: 20 } // This is the new student

// Check if the age is more than 18
if (newStudent.age > 18) {
	students.push(newStudent) // Add the student to the array
}

console.log(students) // Output: [{ name: "Ali", age: 20 }]
```

## What Happened Here?

1. We created an empty array called `students`.
2. Then we made a new object called `newStudent` with a name and age.
3. We checked if `newStudent.age > 18`. Since it is true, we added the student to the array using `.push()`.

---

## Example 2: Using a Function

Sometimes, we need to do this for many objects. Instead of writing the same code again and again, we can use a function.

```javascript
function addStudentIfEligible(array, student) {
	// Check the condition
	if (student.age > 18) {
		array.push(student) // Add student to the array
	}
}

let students = [] // Empty array

addStudentIfEligible(students, { name: 'Sara', age: 22 }) // Add Sara
addStudentIfEligible(students, { name: 'Tom', age: 16 }) // Tom will not be added

console.log(students) // Output: [{ name: "Sara", age: 22 }]
```

# What is Happening?

The function takes two things: an array and an object (student).  
It checks if the student’s age is more than 18.  
If the condition is true, it adds the student to the array.

## Real-Life Example: Add a Product to the Cart

Let’s look at an example from a shopping app. We want to add products to the cart, but only if they are in stock.

```javascript
let cart = [] // Shopping cart is empty at first

function addToCart(product) {
	if (product.inStock) {
		// Check if the product is in stock
		cart.push(product) // Add the product to the cart
		console.log(`${product.name} added to cart!`)
	} else {
		console.log(`${product.name} is out of stock.`)
	}
}

addToCart({ name: 'Laptop', price: 50000, inStock: true })
addToCart({ name: 'Mouse', price: 500, inStock: false })

console.log(cart) // Output: [{ name: "Laptop", price: 50000, inStock: true }]
```

## Tips for Beginners

- **Practice Conditions**: Learn how to use `if` to check rules before doing something.
- **Understand Arrays and Objects**: Know how arrays store items and how objects store data.
- **Keep it Simple**: Start with easy examples like the ones here.

## Conclusion

Adding objects to an array in JavaScript is simple if you practice. Remember to check the condition first and then add.Start with small examples, and you will become better every day.
